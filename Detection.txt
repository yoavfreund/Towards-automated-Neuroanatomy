Our detector consists of a simple candidate detector followed by a
learned classifier that destinguishes cells from non-cells. The
candidate detector operates on the fluorescent marker. It performs a
local normalization of contrast and brightness followed by a threshold
and connected component detection. Each connected component is paired
with the corresponding region in the (neurotrace blue?). These pairs
are called "candidates". Each candidate is transformed into a feature
vector using a set of image analysis functions. A training set
is collected consisting of candidates and corresponding human selected
labels (marked cell / not marked cell). This training set is used as
input to XGBoost. An ensemble of 30 classifiers is generated using
different random seeds. The ensemble is used to partition new
candidates into "sure", "unsure" and "negative". Where "sure" are at
least 90% marked cells, and "unsure" have 50% or lower marked cells.
